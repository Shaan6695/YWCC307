Team Project Team 2 - 
New technology is now capable of communicating and making content in ways
comparable to humans. Itâ€™s called generative artificial intelligence (AI), and you can
use it to excel in the workforce.
Generative AI can save you time, no matter what field you work in. It can create
content for marketing, forecast numbers for finance, or code for software
developers. Publicists can use it write press releases. Health professionals can
even use it to improve their diagnosis. You, the worker, are still in charge, you just
have more freedom to strategize, think big, and excel.
Your team has been engaged by one of the largest thinktanks to help propose
policy suggestions to help minimize the potential negative impact on the jobs,
industry and personal data.
